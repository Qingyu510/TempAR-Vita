# TempAR-Vita
Modified Version of TempAR's Pointer Searcher. This program retains all the original functions of TempAR (Code Converting, pointer searching for PSP and NDS) but also gives the Vita some love.

We're proud to present a new version with a bigger window, Pointer Searching options for the Vita and a new VitaCheat tab that can help you make any code type for the VitaCheat plugin.

TempAR now also features a new High Accuracy mode. The ability to use more than 2 dumps at once is available if you'd like the program to do some of the guesswork for you. You can now use up to 6 dumps and the program will add a few more colors to the mix to show how confident it is that the address you're looking at is the pointer you need. You can still use only 1 or 2 memory dumps and use the familiar black/green addresses. But, using all six memory dump fields will shorten the list of useful addresses dramatically, sometimes only showing a single address that matches all the dumps at once.

The High Accuarcy mode is compatible with all the currently supported dumps (PSP, Vita and NDS) and is completely optional. You can feel free to only use 2 or even 3. But, for those games where hunting for pointers is difficult, all 6 can be used to take a lot of the work out.

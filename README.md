# TempAR-Vita
Modified Version of TempAR's Pointer Searcher. This program retains all the original functions of TempAR (Code Converting, pointer searching for PSP and NDS) but also gives the Vita some love.

We're proud to present a new version with a bigger window, Pointer Searching options for the Vita and a new VitaCheat tab that can help you make any code type for the VitaCheat plugin.
